      - So this professor of educational psychology at the university decided to test me on math. I of course
      beat all his expectations. True to the American dream, he became known for publishing a paper about 
      me in the journal Intelligence.

      - I was asked to give the 23rd root of a 201-digit number. I gave my answer in a mere 50 seconds, which 
      had to be later confirmed by the US Bureau of Standards using the UNIVAC 1101 computer. Confirming
      my answer required writing a special program to perform such a large calculation, and it took the 
      meager computer longer time than me.
